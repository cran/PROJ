## What is PROJ?

Generic map projection transformations on raw data.

We use the [PROJ library](https://proj.org/) to perform projection transformations on raw data. We can
use a matrix or data frame of 2, 3, or 4 columns and these are assumed (if present) to be "x", "y", "z", and "t" (time: modern transformations allow a *temporal* component as the shape of the earth and our models of it do change over time).

The transformation idiom used is 1) provide raw coordinates; 2) specify their source projection; 3) specify their target projection.

We don't enter into the coordinate order debacle of the [OGC](https://www.opengeospatial.org/) for longitude, latitude. Projection strings are able
to carry this information, and passing in the right data is the responsibility of the user.

## Why PROJ?

This package was created to leverage the modern transformation capabilities of [PROJ](https://proj.org/) itself
from version 6 and above. There's no other package in R that allows generic transformations directly from the
PROJ library, and this package provides that along with these goals:

* no other dependencies (PROJ library is it, and R)
* allow geocentric transformations
* provide no interpretation or restrictions on source or target projection specification
* do not require special formats, we use numeric vectors in matrix or data frame form

## What systems are supported?

* Windows - on CRAN the PROJ package should just work, PROJ 6 (or higher) is bundled in with the binary package.
* Linux - the PROJ package will use your system PROJ library, it must be version 6 (or higher).
* Mac - we don't know yet, in the past CRAN makes this work for new packages.

## How to use PROJ?

Get the package installed, load it and use the function `proj_trans_generic()`.

If you don't have system PROJ version 6 (or higher) the function will fail.


```r
library(PROJ)
proj_trans_generic(cbind(c(0, 147), c(0, -42), 0), target = "+proj=laea +datum=WGS84", source = "WGS84")
#> Error in proj_trans_generic(cbind(c(0, 147), c(0, -42), 0), target = "+proj=laea +datum=WGS84", : x coordinates must be 2-columns
```

Note that various forms of projection string are supported, we can use PROJ.4 style (as per target above), bare names from [EPSG](http://www.epsg.org/) (as per source above), full-blown WKT2 strings, or 'auth:code' forms such as "epsg:3857". (Note that "+init=..." forms cannot be used in 6 or above).

The goal is for the [reproj package](https://CRAN.r-project.org/package=reproj) to wrap this package. In time
that will be the easiest way to run coordinate transformations with PROJ for versions 4, 5, 6, 7 or above.

To find out if your system supports PROJ 6 (or higher) use the function `ok_proj6()`.


```r
ok_proj6()
#> [1] TRUE
```
